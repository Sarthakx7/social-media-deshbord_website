I've recently developed a dynamic social media web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive platform offers users a seamless experience to explore new posts, receive notifications, and engage with friends. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1.Post Feed: Users can effortlessly browse through a curated feed of new posts, ensuring they stay updated with the latest content.

2.Notifications: A notification icon alerts users to new activity. Upon clicking, users can view notifications, enhancing their engagement with the platform.

3.Messaging: By clicking on the message icon, users can initiate conversations with friends. The message box is intuitively highlighted for easy access, featuring a search bar to quickly locate and connect with desired contacts.

4.Customization Options: The platform offers a rich array of customization features to tailor the user experience. This includes:
      • Font Size: Users can adjust the font size to their preference, choosing from various options for     
    optimal readability.
      • Color Palette: A diverse selection of color options allows users to personalize their interface,   
    reflecting their unique style and preferences.
      • Background Themes: Users have the flexibility to switch between different background themes, including 
    light, dark, and more dark (darker), ensuring visual comfort and aesthetic appeal.
